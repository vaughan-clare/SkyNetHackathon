Google Scholar's Retreat 2014 Project * Sprout *
---------------------------------------------------------------
It is hard to answer questions you do not yet know how to ask especially in the tech field. Instead, Sprout provides pre-defined "guideline" questions (we call sprouts) posed by seasoned developers to help send you on a path to a streamlined solution that fits you. We know one-solution does not fit all, so we allow you to create your own sprouts after getting stuck yourself or to specifically serve a population you know and understand.
